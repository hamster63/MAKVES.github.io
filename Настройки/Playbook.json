By gaining control over a large number of hijacked</p>\n<p>systems and devices (referred to as a botnet), attackers can direct large amounts of</p>\n<p>connection requests or packets of random data at a single target all at once, with the</p>\n<p>intention of overloading the system and taking it offline.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br></p>\n<p>What makes protection a challenge:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br></p>\n<p>The larger the botnet, the more damage a DDoS attack can do. The best you can hope</p>\n<p>for when you’re attacked is that you’re subscribed to an anti-DDoS service, but even that</p>\n<p>doesn’t provide a guarantee you’ll stay up and running if you’re dealing with an attack</p>\n<p>with a high level of magnitude.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br></p>\n<p>To make matters worse, sometimes attackers will contact their targets ahead of time</p>\n<p>and threaten to knock them offline unless “protection money” is paid up front. It can</p>\n<p>be difficult to discern whether such threats or simply scams, and — as is the case with</p>\n<p>ransomware — giving in to criminal extortion demands never comes with a guarantee.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n",
